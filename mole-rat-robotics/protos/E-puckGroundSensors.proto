# Ground sensors extension for the e-puck robot.
#
# It includes three infra-red proximity sensors
# pointing down to the ground in front of the robot.

# Modified by Karl R. Wurst
# Moved the sensors further apart and angled them outwards
# so that they do not need to be over the line to sense the line
# This means the the robot stays between the lines.
